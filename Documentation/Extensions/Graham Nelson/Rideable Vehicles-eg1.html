<a href="javascript:pasteCode2866()"><img border=0 src=inform:/doc_images/paste.png></a>&nbsp;<b>Rideable Vehicles<font color="#404040"> by </font>Graham Nelson</b><p><small><p>Version 3 built in to Inform</small><p>Vehicles which one sits on top of, rather than inside, such as elephants or
motorcycles.<p>Kinds: <b>rideable animal</b> (a kind of animal), <b>rideable vehicle</b> (a kind of supporter)<p>Actions: <b>Mounting</b>, <b>Dismounting</b><p>Adjectives: <b>vehicular</b><p><p><hr><p>
<p>
 Inform's built-in &quot;vehicle&quot; kind assumes that the vehicle is a container, which is fine for cars or hot-air balloons, but not so good for a pony or a four-wheeled lawnmower, which one rides rather than gets inside. Rideable Vehicles is an extension which creates two more kinds: &quot;rideable animal&quot; (good for the pony) and &quot;rideable vehicle&quot; (good for the lawnmower).
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The pony is a rideable animal in the Forest Clearing.<br> The lawnmover is a rideable vehicle in the Garden Shed.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This means that three different kinds of thing can be used as a means of travel, which might make it awkward to write a general rule about them, so we also define the adjective &quot;vehicular&quot; for any thing of any of these kinds.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The Transport Museum is a room. &quot;The Museum is filled with means of transport old and new, including [list of vehicular things in the Transport Museum].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 A new action called &quot;mounting&quot; is created, and a new command &quot;mount&quot; (or &quot;ride&quot;) is added for the player to use. Thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Instead of mounting the pony, say &quot;The pony snorts and backs off.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 results in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &gt;ride pony<br> The pony snorts and backs off.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 And a corresponding &quot;dismounting&quot; action handles the command &quot;dismount&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &gt;dismount<br> You get off the pony.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Moreover, commands such as &quot;get off the pony&quot; or &quot;get on the lawnmower&quot; are converted into these new actions instead, so that rules like the following will always work, no matter what command is tried:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Instead of mounting the tricycle when the transport pass is not carried by the player:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;The tricycle can only be ridden by those with a transport pass.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Lastly, a special rule means that &quot;pony, go east&quot; is recognised when the player is riding the pony. (This works for rideable animals, but not rideable vehicles.)
