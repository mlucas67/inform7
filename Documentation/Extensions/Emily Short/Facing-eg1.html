 Facing allows the player to LOOK a direction and be told what lies in that area.
<p>
<p><a name=docsec1><b><font color="#800000">Chapter 1: Added Abilities</b></font>
<p>
<p><a name=docsec2><b><font color="#000000">Section 1.1: New actions</b></font>
<p>
 Facing adds the actions &quot;facing [a direction]&quot; and &quot;looking toward [a room]&quot;. When the player does one of these actions, he is told what room lies in that direction, unless a closed door intervenes. LOOK THROUGH DOOR also redirects to the same action. In processing these actions, it assigns three variables:
<p>
 (1) the occluding door, if any, is the door that stands in the way of the player's line of sight;
<p>
 (2) the direction faced is the direction in which he is looking;
<p>
 (3) the viewed location is the room that the player will see if the door is not closed.
<p>
 These actions are also implemented for non-player characters, so that characters instructed to look some direction will try to do so.
<p>
<p><a name=docsec3><b><font color="#000000">Section 1.2: New phrases</b></font>
<p>
 In the process of discovering these, Facing also defines some phrases that may be useful in general:
<p>
 (1) the door between (this place - a room) and (that place - a room) returns the door between two rooms, if any; e.g.,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> the door between the barn and the yard</font></blockquote>
<p>
... which will be a door if there is one, and nothing if there isn't.
<p>
<p><a name=docsec4><b><font color="#000000">Section 1.3: Implicit Actions</b></font>
<p>
 If the player or a non-player character needs to look through a closed door, an open action will be generated automatically. The implicit action follows the conventions of Emily Short's Locksmith extension: if we &quot;Use sequential action&quot;, this will be reported as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> You open the white door.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> You can see the hallway.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 but otherwise reported as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> (first opening the white door)<br> You can see the hallway.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 To override this implicit action, replace the &quot;can't see through closed door rule&quot; with another that merely checks whether the occluding door is closed and, if so, stops the action.
<p>
 Doors that are transparent may be seen through even when closed.
<p>

<p>
<p><a name=docsec6><b><font color="#000000">Section 2.1: Distantly describing</b></font>
<p>
 Finally, Facing adds a distantly describing activity that controls how a room is seen from the outside. By default, this is the distantly describing rule:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Rule for distantly describing a room (called target):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let N be indexed text;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now N is &quot;[the target]&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;You make out [N in lower case] that way.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 But we may change this for a specific room, so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Rule for distantly describing the hallway:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;The hallway is quite crowded at this time of day.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 If we need to work around the lower-casing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Rule for distantly describing a city (called the target):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;You make out [the target] that way.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 If we need to acknowledge the door through which we are looking:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Rule for distantly describing the changing room when the occluding door is a door:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let N be indexed text;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now N is &quot;[the changing room]&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;You glance through [the occluding door] at [N in lower case].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><a name=docsec7><b><font color="#000000">Section 2.2: nothing-to-see-that-way</b></font>
<p>
 The most common other piece of textual output is &quot;You can make out nothing that way.&quot;, the default response printed when the player looks in a direction that does not reveal a room.
<p>
 To replace this in play with our own preferred text, we might add a line such as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> When play begins:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now nothing-to-see-that-way is &quot;We can't see anything interesting in that direction.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>

<p>
<p><a name=docsec9><b><font color="#000000">Section 3.1: Dependencies</b></font>
<p>
 Facing requires Plurality by Emily Short. It is compatible with Locksmith but does not depend on its inclusion.
<p>
<p><a name=docsec10><b><font color="#000000">Section 3.2: Change log</b></font>
<p>
 Version 5 isolates some of the text to make it more replaceable and upgrades the documentation with better section headings. Version 6 updates for the greater strictness of Inform 5T18, which requires that we say doors can be transparent before making them so.
<p>
 Version 9 updates for 6E59, removing deprecated features. It also removes a number of phrases formerly defined inside Facing, because equivalent ones are now built into the standard rules.
