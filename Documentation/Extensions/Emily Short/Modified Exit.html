<p>
 Modified Exit makes a few minor tweaks to the way the Standard Rules handle exits and containers.
<p>
 Most trivially, it adds the synonyms &gt;EXIT THING and &gt;GET OUT OF THING for the existing &gt;GET OFF THING; and it allows the getting off action to apply to containers as well as to supporters. Thus &gt;GET OUT OF BOAT should work as well as &gt;GET OFF DAIS.
<p>
 Second, it implements rules so that a player will automatically rise from an enterable portable object before attempting to take that object (as in the case of camp chairs, picnic blankets, and the like).
<p>
 Third, it makes the player automatically rise from his seat, bed, or any other enterable thing that is not a vehicle, before attempting to go in a direction, except in the case that the chosen direction leads nowhere. In that case, the player does not bother to get up, but a sensible refusal message is printed instead.
<p>
 Another effect of the Modified Exit extension is that, if the player is not in a container of some kind, &gt;OUT and its equivalents always try to go outside (rather than printing the &quot;But you aren't in anything at the moment.&quot; message Inform uses as a default if there is no room outside from the current location). For instance, currently
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The Chamber is a room. North of the Chamber is the Barracks. Instead of going outside in the Chamber, try going north.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 will never cause the instead rule to fire, because the &quot;convert exit into go out rule&quot; in the standard rules will determine that there is no point in generating the GO OUT action in the first place, so the player would see
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Chamber</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &gt;out<br> But you aren't in anything at the moment.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 With Modified Exit, we would instead get
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Chamber</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &gt;out</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Barracks</font></blockquote>
<p>
 There is one additional exception: Modified Exit does not allow &quot;stand&quot; or &quot;stand up&quot; to be converted to &gt;GO OUTSIDE. Thus we get
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Chamber</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &gt;out</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Barracks</font></blockquote>
<p>
 but
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Chamber</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &gt;stand up<br> But you aren't in anything at the moment.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Finally, Modified Exit observes the &quot;sequential action&quot; option, meaning that if we would like the player's implicit actions to be described one after another as normal reports rather than as &quot;(first getting off the divan)&quot;, we may use
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Use sequential action.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This corresponds to the behavior of the Locksmith extension and some other extensions by the same author.
<p>
 When sequential action is used, we suppress the &quot;describe room stood up into&quot; rule and the &quot;describe room emerged into&quot; rule, because otherwise the game prints two room descriptions whenever the player moves -- the description of the room that held the container, and the description of the new room to which he travels, like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &gt;w<br> You get out of the box.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Cell<br> You can see a box (empty) here.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Hallway<br> This is the hall outside your Cell.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 With the descriptions suppressed, we instead get
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &gt;w<br> You get out of the box.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Hallway<br> This is the hall outside your Cell.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 If we do NOT want to suppress the first of the two room descriptions, we write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The no room description on exit rule is not listed in any rulebook.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Version 4 of Modified Exit is identical to version 3 except that it is made compatible with Postures by Emily Short. If Postures is included, Modified Exit does not define a STAND UP action, but relies on the more sophisticated implementation included there.
<p>
 Version 5 adds a tweak for compatibility with Rideable Vehicles by Graham Nelson, the removal of some procedural rules, and a minor fix to output.
