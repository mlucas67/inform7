Version 3 of Default Messages by Ron Newcomb begins here.

"Allows customizing the standard messages in the Inform library.  A ground-up reimplementation of David Fisher's extension that economizes on memory."

Section - Default Messages

Use library message alerts translates as (- Constant LIBRARY_MESSAGE_ALERTS; -). 

To say library message verb: (- PrintCommand(); -). [prints the whole command except for the person asked & the comma]
To say library message pronoun: (- print (address) pronoun_word; -).
To say ignore library line break: (- lm_n = -1; -).

The main object is an object that varies. The main object variable translates into I6 as "lm_o".
The secondary object is an object that varies. The secondary object variable translates into I6 as "lm_o2".]

Default Messages ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

This extension allows the author to replace the many bits of prose that exist inside Inform 7.  It is done by continuing a table, Custom Library Messages, like so:
	*: Table of custom library messages (continued)
	library-action	library-message-id	library-message-text
	--					   10				   "I beg your pardon, but I didn't catch your drift."
	going action			   2				   "You can't go [noun] from here."


The first column holds the action to which the message applies, or if the message comes from some other place, a blank entry.  Because each action has multiple messages (roughly one per rule), the second column holds a number that selects which.  An action's messages are typically numbered from 1 on up.  To see which number a particular message is, we can be alerted when the message happens.
	*: Use library message alerts.

This gives something like the following transcript.
	> TAKE PILLOW
	{ taking action #1 }
	
	Taken.
	
	> TAKE A NAP
	{ library message #30 }
	
	You can't see any such thing.
	
We then add to the table as appropriate.  If the action within the curly braces is "library message", then we use the -- blank entry in the action column.
	*: Table of custom library messages (continued)
	library-action	library-message-id	library-message-text
	taking action	   1		   "You've always wanted [a noun]."
	--			   30		   "I don't know the word '[the misunderstood word]'."

It is worth mentioning that once we replace a default message, the use option will no longer alert us when it's used.  Thus, when our first readers give us a transcript of their experience, we can search the transcript for the # hash or } brace characters to quickly find what defaults have not yet been replaced.  Furthermore, alerts are always turned off in a release build, just in case the option is long forgotten when it comes time to publish.

There's a few variables that come in handy for certain messages. "The noun" and "the second noun" are of course available, as is "the number understood" and similar.  The others are:
	the person asked -- we cannot use "the actor" within our table, but this is identical.


	library message verb -- this would be "take" for the taking action, "go" for the going action, etc. (More precisely, it is the entire command predicate typically used in "What do you want to take?") 


	library message pronoun -- when our reader uses a pronoun, this is the pronoun she used.


	pronoun reference object -- the noun that the above pronoun refers to.


	library message object, second library message object, library message amount -- effectively synonymous with the noun, the second noun, and the number understood for non-action messages.


	library message action, library message number -- these are the variables that are compared to our two table columns.  The first differs from the library message verb in that it has the present participle ("taking") rather than the root form ("take").  For actions which take two nouns, the preposition is also included ("giving it to").


A final note on line breaks: usually the extension guesses correctly, but for those cases where it adds an extra, the say phrase "[ignore library line break]" should cure it.  (This can be mixed-n-matched with the normal "[run paragraph on]" if need be.)

	*: Table of custom library messages (continued)
	library-action	library-message-id	library-message-text
	--					   35				   "I see nothing that '[library message pronoun]' could possibly refer to." 
	going action			   2				   "I don't think [library message action] [noun] from here is possible."
	--					   49				   "Which will you [library message verb]?"
	giving it to action		   2				   "You put [the noun] into your other hand."
	--					   50				   "You've [if library message amount > 0]gained[otherwise]lost[end if] [library message amount in words] point[s][ignore library line break]"


Example: * Poster Shopping - A vignette.

	*: "Poster Shopping"
	
	Include Default Messages by Ron Newcomb.  Use library message alerts.
	
	The poster shop is a room.
	
	The horror movie poster is a lit thing in the poster shop. 
	The romantic movie poster is a thing in the poster shop.
	The fantasy movie poster is a thing in the poster shop.
	
	Carry out examining the player for the first time: increase the score by 2.
	
	Table of custom library messages (continued)
	library-action	library-message-id	library-message-text
	taking inventory action	1				"You've decided to acquire a new movie poster."
	--					10				"I didn't catch your drift there."
	--					109				" (glows in the dark"
	taking action			1				"You go for [the noun]."
	going action			2				"Born and raised in the city, you have no idea what direction is [noun]."
	--					49				"Which poster will you [library message verb]?"
	--					35				"I see nothing that '[library message pronoun]' could possibly refer to." 
	--					50				"You've [if library message amount > 0]gained[otherwise]lost[end if] [library message amount in words] point[s][ignore library line break]"
	--					75				" A [random carried thing] adorns your wall [ignore library line break]"
	
	Instead of going when something is carried, end the story.
	
	Test me with "x me / i / / take / her / s / take horror poster / i / s ".

Example: * But Then What? - Regarding a snafu with the "only understood as far as" error.

Unlike the "What would you like to..." message which incorporates the relevant part of the player's command into itself, the parser error "I only understood you as far as.." does not.  We can change the message, but the player's command will always be tacked on afterward, making it difficult if we wish to end the response with a close quote, a closing bracket, roman type, etc.  For this situation, we must use a rule.  (If we use both, the rule is consulted first.  This can be useful if we want to add "when..." conditions to the rule:  the table's version would be used when no rules apply.)

For additional measure, a phrase printing the rest of the command, and a phrase deciding if the misunderstood word is known at all, also appear.

	*: "But Then What?"
	
	Include Default Messages by Ron Newcomb.
	
	There is a room called In the Spotlight.   

	Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the only understood as far as error:
		say "'You wanted to [library message verb] but what did you mean by the word [misunderstood word] in ['][what was misunderstood][']?'" 
	
	To decide which snippet is what was misunderstood: 
		(- (((wn - 1) * 100) + (WordCount() - 2)) -).
	
	To decide which snippet is the misunderstood word: 
		(- (((wn - 1) * 100) + 1) -).

	Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the only understood as far as error and the misunderstood word is known elsewhere:
		say "'You wanted to [library message verb] but, although I know the word [misunderstood word], I wasn't expecting it there.'" 
	
	To decide if the misunderstood word is known elsewhere: 
		(- (wn--, NextWord() ~= 0) -).
	
	Test me with "examine me now / examine me closely now /  examine me spotlight".

Example: * Tips & Techniques - This appendix contains phrases for miscellaneous tasks:  testing and finding messages, finding bits of information, etc.

This testing command will print the library message for any number given on the command line.  For example, entering MISC 9 will print "It is now pitch dark in here!", or whatever message we've replaced it with.
	Understand "misc [number]" as a mistake ("[miscellaneous library message the number understood][run paragraph on]").
	
	To say miscellaneous library message (N - a number): 
		(- L__M( ##Miscellany, {N} ); -).


The following will print the names of all the actions as they should appear in the table.  This is useful when we can't figure out the exact wording.  (Note that one action, "the requesting the story file version action", has no text of its own to replace, so will never appear in our table.)
	When play begins: 
		repeat with X running through all action names:
			say "[X] action."


A common parser message in games of yore went along the lines of "I don't understand the word 'kludge'."  For this, miscellaneous message #30 could use "[the misunderstood word]".  Try it with "examine lovely me."  Or try it in miscellaneous message #23 with "I don't know a Mr. [misunderstood word]."  Test that one with "Elvis, look" after Elvis has left the story.  Note that it isn't always set properly, so try many variations just in case.
	To decide which snippet is the misunderstood word:
		(- (((wn - 1) * 100) + 1) -).

Similarly for the "I only understood you as far as examining yourself." in response to commands like EXAMINE ME CLOSELY NOW comes the rest of the phrase.  See the previous example "But Then What?" for its usage.
	To decide which snippet is what was misunderstood: 
		(- (((wn - 1) * 100) + (WordCount() - 2)) -).

One more tool for some parser messages is asking whether the misunderstood word is known at all, or is known but not expected at the place where the player used it.  
	To decide if the misunderstood word is known at all: 
		(- (wn--, NextWord() ~= 0) -).


Related is entering action #2, "That's not something you can enter/stand/sit on."  Regardless whether the player sits on a chair, lies on a bed, climbs into a car, or stands on a stool, the same action, entering, is used.  But when the player attempts these actions on something that isn't enterable, it's nice if the refusal message correctly acknowledges which action the player tried.   We do this by again quoting the relevant part of the player's command, namely, "[the quoted verb]".  Additionally, the standard message, in order to tack on appropriate prepositions, sends the snippet to a phrase that works much like an After Reading A Command rule.  Try that one with "[the quoted verb posture]".  
	To decide which snippet is the quoted verb: 
		(- ((verb_wordnum * 100) + 1) -).  [if command is TAKE OFF HAT, gives just TAKE]
	
	To decide which text is (quoted word - a snippet) posture:
		if the quoted word matches "stand", decide on "stand on";
		if the quoted word matches "sit", decide on "sit down on";
		if the quoted word matches "lie", decide on "lie down on";
		otherwise decide on "enter".


Snippets in general are very useful things when used to liven up error messages. For example, replacing the bland "There is no reply." of the catch-all answering action with "'And [the topic understood] to you too, good sir,' replies [the noun]." goes a long way in sustaining versimilitude.  So what, then, is a snippet?  It is a run of words, entered by the player, such as "the three words starting at word #4" which picks word #4, word #5, and word #6, including the spaces between.
	To decide which snippet is the (amount - a number) words/word starting with/at word number (position - a number): 
		(- (({position} * 100) + {amount}) -).

	To decide which snippet is the player's first two command words: 
		decide on the two words starting with word number one.	

	To decide which number is the position of the verb: 
		(- (verb_wordnum) -).



One message, taking action #13, mentions the player putting something into his holdall.  While a phrase such as "[a random player's holdall]" would likely suffice when we replace the message, games with more than one holdall might need the following variable.
	The current player's holdall is a player's holdall that varies. 
	The current player's holdall variable translates into I6 as "SACK_OBJECT".


Several standard messages need to list several objects, notably opening, searching, and looking.  While this may be one time where using rule-replacement is the way to go, listing the contents from a say phrase is a generally useful thing to have.  And since commas cannot appear in say-phrases, try replacing them with plus signs, such as this doozy from opening action #4: "You open [the noun], revealing [if the number of not undescribed not scenery things in the noun is at least one][list the contents of the noun with the as a sentence list option + the tersely list option + the not listing concealed items list option][otherwise]nothing[end if]."  

We'll even throw in a section heading for free, keeping the contents pane of the index tidy.
	Section - List the Contents of Something, with added options
	
	To say list the contents of (X - object) with (N - number): (- WriteListFrom(child({X}), {N}); -).
	
	The as a sentence list option is a number that varies. The as a sentence list option variable translates into I6 as "ENGLISH_BIT".
	The tersely list option is a number that varies. The tersely list option variable translates into I6 as "TERSE_BIT".
	
	The is-are list option is a number that varies. The is-are list option variable translates into I6 as "ISARE_BIT". 
	
	The suppressing all articles list option is a number that varies. The suppressing all articles list option variable translates into I6 as "NOARTICLE_BIT". 
	The using the definite article list option is a number that varies. The using the definite article list option variable translates into I6 as "DEFART_BIT".
	The capitalise first article list option is a number that varies. The capitalise first article list option variable translates into I6 as "CFIRSTART_BIT".
	
	With newlines list option is a number that varies. The with newlines list option variable translates into I6 as "NEWLINE_BIT". 
	The indented list option is a number that varies. The indented list option variable translates into I6 as "INDENT_BIT".
	With extra indentation list option is a number that varies. The with extra indentation list option variable translates into I6 as "EXTRAINDENT_BIT". 
	
	The giving brief inventory information list option is a number that varies. The giving brief inventory information list option variable translates into I6 as "PARTINV_BIT".
	The giving inventory information list option is a number that varies. The giving inventory information list option variable translates into I6 as "FULLINV_BIT".
	
	The including contents list option is a number that varies. The including contents list option variable translates into I6 as "RECURSE_BIT". 
	The including all contents list option is a number that varies. The including all contents list option variable translates into I6 as "ALWAYS_BIT".
	
	The not listing concealed items list option is a number that varies. The not listing concealed items list option variable translates into I6 as "CONCEAL_BIT".
	The listing marked items only list option is a number that varies. The listing marked items only list option variable translates into I6 as "WORKFLAG_BIT".


Finally is a technical trick that could free up enough space for a page or so of prose.  This extension works much like Instead Of rules:  it gets first chance at any message to be printed, and when it finds a situation to which it applies (i.e., the message to be printed is in the table of custom default messages,) it says its own message "instead".  The original message still sits in memory, taking up space needlessly.  But because all the original messages are contained within the same monolithic rule, we cannot de-list that rule.  Unless, of course, our table has all messages in it anyway.  Even if we have only half the number of messages re-written, copying the remaining ones unaltered to our table could be worth it just to de-list that rule.  With this:

	Include (-  
	[ LanguageLM; 
	#ifdef DEBUG;  
		print "{ ";
		if (lm_act == ##Miscellany or ##ListMiscellany) print "library message";
		else print (SayActionName) lm_act, " action";
		print " #", lm_n, " }";
	#endif;
	];  -) instead of "Long Texts" in "Language.i6t".

That gains us back about 10K of memory, which is about 2K words of prose, give or take.  (We do leave in an error message in the debug build to flag anything we missed, just in case.)


Example: * The Complete Table - A fully complete table of library messages.  Find a message within, or copy pieces out.

This lists every message in the Inform standard library. If searching for a particular message within, aim for unique words like achieve or unexpected.  Pronouns and verbs tend to alter their own forms with say-phrases, so a search for touches, rather than touch, would likely fail. 

In order to use this table as-is, the extension Plurality by Emily Short is needed, plus the phrases presented beneath the table, as well as many of the tidbits in the Tips & Techniques example presented above.
